  "<strong>Bullet Blitz</strong> is a 2D multiplayer shooter I developed using <em>Unity</em> and <em>C#</em>. I designed and implemented core gameplay systems, including the character controller, weapon mechanics, and the aerial mobility system (double jump + mid-air shooting). I also built and optimized online multiplayer functionality using <em>Unity Netcode</em>, ensuring responsive and competitive play. The project showcases my strengths in gameplay programming, real-time networking, and delivering tight, responsive controls in a fast-paced environment.",
  "Currently in development: A dungeon-crawling RPG focused on exploration and steady progression. Jump into short, replayable dungeon runs—each packed with secrets, traps, and loot—while building your strength between dives. Perfect for quick sessions with lasting rewards. Early stages, but big ambitions!",
  "LuvBug Learning: An educational game platform focused on social-emotional learning for kids. I contributed to the checkpoint system embedded in the platform to track progress and enhance engagement, and implemented gameplay features across multiple mini-games to support interactive learning.",
  "Cosmic Survival was completed in 2 months' time.

  "Currently in development: Beat Hero – a fast-paced rhythm game where you block incoming beats in perfect time with the music. Precision and rhythm are your weapons as you clash with the beat in colorful, energetic levels. Just a 1-day demo for now—but it's a tight, playable core with plenty of room to grow into something big.",
  "NthState is a physics-driven puzzle game built around the idea that your environment is your only tool. Created for a game jam with the theme ‘Your environment impacts you,’ the game features a rotating world mechanic—there’s no player character, only momentum, gravity, and clever level design. Experiment with angles, collisions, and realistic bounces as you guide objects to victory through pure environmental control. A unique challenge born from deep physics tuning and creative constraint. </br></br>Play for free on itch.io : <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://depressedcookie.itch.io/nth-state\" style=\"color: blue;\"> Click here to play </a>",
  "PaintMan is an infinite runner created in 48 hours for the theme ‘Color changes everything’. Control a character collecting paint orbs to change or mix your body color and match the upcoming gates. Instead of using procedural generation, a teleportation loop keeps the runway endless and seamless. Developed as both a creative and technical challenge, PaintMan explores shader programming, material manipulation, and Unity’s new input system—all wrapped in a vibrant, color-focused experience. </br></br>Play for free on itch.io : <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://depressedcookie.itch.io/paintman\" style=\"color: blue;\"> Click here to play </a>",
  "Dust Explosion is a UE4 experimental project built using both C++ and Blueprints, designed as a testbed for deeper Unreal Engine development. Focused on expanding C++ skills, the project features a modular, object-oriented weapon system, allowing for easy extension and customization. It also includes AI voice acting via a custom voice trigger system, adding personality to the gameplay. Player hands and weapons were modeled and animated from scratch, with a reactive camera system that enhances realism—especially when shrunk. Subtle touches of game feel were added to bring the level to life, making it both a technical and creative exploration.",

  "Matching Bird is the very first game that I made back in high school. The game was written in pure Java and with default drawing functions. It was sure an enlightenment. I learned how computers draws vertices and fills pixels, how to process keyboard and mouse inputs. I also learned how to program a simple collision. During the development of the game, I tried and explored a lot of things that came up on my mind that could be achieved by programming."
